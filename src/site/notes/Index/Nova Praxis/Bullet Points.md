## Introduction
Hi! This is Taylre. I rewrote parts of the bullet points section from the Nova Praxis book. Here it is! All the parts under italicized headings are to varying extents rewritten. If a section is mostly the same except for a thing here or there I bolded/italicized the new different thing.

## *Earth Lost It’s Way* 
Most of humanity has left earth behind. 

As climate change ravaged the planet after the unchecked capitalism of the late 1900s and early 2000s, the world was unable to work together to make the changes necessary to save the planet. Humanity descended into widespread war, disease, and famine. What few bastions of modernity existed by 2050 were choked with refugees, home-grown terrorism, and civil unrest. 

As earth’s governments crumbled, the largest companies — no longer able to squeeze ever-increasing pennies out of the populace by economics alone — slowly eclipsed nations as the primary purveyors of currency, laws, social services, and more. Every human became a slave to one company or another; to fascist overlords thinly disguised as businessmen.

## *The Singularity and Mimir* 
Though technological advancement had been slowed by the global climate crises, Free Intelligence, one of the most powerful companies on earth at the time, continued research into realms no one else dared cross, despite the existential risks and literal energy toll it took. 

In the year 2063, the exponential pace of technological advancement gave way to an AI of unprecedented potential. This AI, called Mimir (pronounced “Me-Mer”), ran for three months. During its short lifespan, it advanced human technology by nearly a millennia. 

But three months was not long enough to save earth. Before Mimir was able to present a solution to earth’s climate crises, a massive solar flare devastated the planet. Nearly all satellite communications and all essential functions of technology and modern life were wiped out for months or years. With them went Mimir. Though they brought Mimir back as soon as they could, Mimir was never alive like it was before. It was just another super advanced chat bot. It couldn’t save the world. Never again could anyone bring back the spark which made Mimir what it was.

Humanity now combs through Mimir’s research archives in search of new technology. The Archives are publicly available to all on the Extranet, but it typically requires large teams with tremendous funding to find anything useful. 
## *Space and Other Worlds*
It took humanity almost a century to come back after the Flare. After the systems that held up modernity were yanked away, society entirely collapsed. Most of the population died. It was only by the grace of Mimir’s discoveries that humanity was able to rebuild at all. From a clean slate, humanity launched into the stars.

Mimir’s most advanced creation was then jump drive, which allowed spacecraft to travel great distances in only a few hours. This finally made utilization and colonization of the solar system (now called “Sol”) possible, through a system-spanning jump ring network.

The largest portion of humans remain in the Sol system, particularly on Luna and Mars. The rest inhabit other planets, moons, and space stations in the Sol system. And there are dozens of other expeditions and colonies, both in Sol system and beyond, that people call home.

## *The Shelters* (New!)
Earth has largely been abandoned by average folk, and by the Houses. But around a fifth of humanity still lives there — the poorest and most unfortunate, prisoners, as well as Apostates looking to stay out of the House’s eye (explained later), stay on Earth. Most inhabitants of earth live in “Shelters” that are nominally run by the broken remains of old Earth governments. 

Every shelter is vastly different, but few are happy or ideal. The shelters, however, are the only places that can provide some bit of modern living conditions, with breathable air, walls to keep out the weather and solar radiation, and semi-reliable water rations. Shelter denizens beg the Houses for aid, desperate to get off planet but never rich enough to leave. The Houses claim they will not interfere with Earth’s proper governments, but in reality earth’s governments can’t hold a candle to the galaxy-spanning Coalition; their real motivation is that it would be a terrible business move for them to take on the burden of a dying planet. It’s common for religious groups to send missionaries to Earth.

Among the few on earth who do not live in the shelters, there are prisoners -- in the hellhole earth prisons where criminals pray they will never be sent -- and nomads.  Nomads make their own way in the Earth’s near-inhospitable climes. These bands are most often full of escaped criminals and Apostates.
## *The Coalition and The Houses*
The remnant the of the those all-powerful global corporations from before the Flare would eventually become the Houses when the new utopia was built, and came together to form the Coalition of Free States.

The Coalition is, for most of humanity (outside of Earth), the only officially recognized government.  It is made up of “Houses” — a play on the marketing name originally given to the first settlements outside of Earth —  of which every Coalition citizen is a member. 

Coalition citizens have all their needs met by the government, and live in what many would describe as a utopia. But they pay for this utopia with their privacy and freedoms, and there are many who chafe against the restrictions placed upon them.
## *Apostates*
Not everyone is a member of the Coalition. Some choose, or are forced by circumstance, to live outside the Coalition. These non-citizens are called Apostates, and do not have House membership.

Many apostates survive by avoiding the Coalition’s Protectorate and surviving on the outskirts of civilization — ***on Earth***, on backwater mining colonies, etc. Some (Especially former Earthlings) work for one of the Houses in hopes of gaining citizenship, usually slaving for years with very little hope of success.

Apostates who live apart from the Coalition are certainly more free than Coalition citizens, but do not benefit from the Coalitions resources. For many apostates, every day is a struggle to get by.

## A (Nearly) Post-Scarcity Economy 
Advanced technology has made it possible to dissolve the barriers between people and the resources they need to survive. This new era of abundance was made possible by the compiler technology created by Mimir, and is enforced by the Coalition itself.  

Most citizens own at least one compiler and decompiler. These devices are used to quickly fabricate finished goods from raw materials, or break compiled items back down into raw materials. This results in nearly 100% efficient recycling. 

With the collapse of the world’s economies, and the devaluation of most goods, a new economy arose; one built on Reputation. All Coalition citizens have a Rep-Rating, which determines what resources they are allowed to utilize in excess of the default standard available to all citizens. 

A person’s Rep-Rating is affected by how people see you, how much you are respected, and how much you have given back to society. It is literally an attempt to quantify the value of a person, and it is determined by one’s behavior and one’s peers. 

Make enemies, leave bad impressions, or use more than your fair share, and you might find yourself ostracized and cut off from the finer things in life. 

Apostates are not part of the Reputation economy, and instead barter for their goods and services. More organized apostate enclaves and networks are also known to use gold as a currency, though this can be dangerous since the Coalition has outlawed the minting of physical currency.

## *Transhumanity* 
Nova Praxis is a setting that explores the co-evolution of humans and technology. Mimir’s inventions, called Mimir-tech, changed everything. And it paved the way for humanity to change itself. 

Bioware augmentations affect the genetic code of an individual, protecting her against disease and providing any number of biological enhancements. 

Cyberware is where man meets machine. Nanotechnological machine components are introduced into the body, resulting in powerful enhancements, upgraded or additional limbs, senses, or protection. 

Of note, the single most powerful and controversial type of augmentation is a process called Apotheosis. During Apotheosis, the recipient’s brain is gradually, slowly, and seamlessly replaced by a network of nanomachines called a Mindset. 

Once complete, the recipient still feels and behaves like himself. But he is not. His mind has been transformed into software, and runs on a cybernetic brain. Once the mind has made the transition, it can be downloaded into other bodies, called “sleeves”, or left to live in a virtual environment as a Substrate Independent Mind (SIM). Minds can be backed up, restored, copied, and even combined.

***Roughly 15%*** of humanity has now undergone Apotheosis, and that number grows with each passing year. Advanced technology has changed many aspects of life. Data can be streamed directly into the visual cortex. Communication can happen with a thought. Memories can be recorded and played back later. Virtual worlds can be made indistinguishable from reality, and people count on digital agents to answer questions, offer advice, and help manage their lives. We have become a human-machine civilization, a symbiotic union of the mind and software, the organic and synthetic.

## *The Mesh and the Digital Divide* 
Everything is connected. In highly built-up Coalition controlled areas, the environment itself can be like one big machine. Sensors are everywhere. The machine sees all, and hears all. This is the Mesh. 

This massive stream of sensory data flows through the Monitors, powerful AIs created specifically to watch and report on events the Coalition government might find interesting. They log crimes, and are the eyes and ears of Inter-Rep, the organization that administers the Reputation system. 

But the Mesh is far more than a ubiquitous security system; it is the always-on connection to the machines around you. Personal devices and augmentations connect to the mesh, and rely on its vast network of sensors to provide data and interpret the user’s words and gestures as commands.

*Even in areas where the mesh isn't as built out and omnipresent as it is in big Coalition cities, most citizens can rely on a constant connection to the Extranet almost everywhere they can find civilization; and that somehow, coalition eyes might be watching.*

*There are always places even in Coalition cities where the mesh is especially weak, and of course it cannot reach into space. If you're smart, there ways to get around the constant surveillance, regardless.*

## Savants
In a world of computers, the admin is god. Savants are rare Apotheosized individuals who have hacked their Mindsets, enabling them to hack other computers and interface with machines in a manner far beyond the norm. 

Savants can direct swarms of nanomachines with a thought, view distant locations through mesh sensors, dive into another person’s digital dirty secrets, control a habitat’s atmospheric and artificial gravity systems, and far more. Savants are rare, mysterious, and feared by anyone with any sense. Software and systems become extensions of their will, and they can turn the very environment itself against their enemies

## The Humanity Preservation Act 
As might be expected, not everyone is eager to become software or otherwise tamper with their humanity. Members of various Purist movements actively fight against the proliferation of augmentation technology. They fear that they will one day be forced to augment themselves to remain competitive or even safe. These people see Savants and post-human aberrants as proof that augmentation tech must be outlawed, or at least more tightly controlled. 

The Humanity Preservation Act was put into place to do just that. The HPA limits how far a person can be legally augmented, insures that minds suffering from extreme Fragmentation are not restored, and bans the practice of leaving more than one copy of a mind active at a time.

## *Open Conflict* 
The Coalition’s military and police, called the Protectorate, engages in small scale conflicts on a regular basis. 

Piracy is a constant concern, as civilian and military craft are regularly hijacked by apostates for their supplies. These supplies usually go back to a hidden community somewhere, but are sometimes used to supply a budding resistance force. 

The Remnants of Earth’s governments still exist, with operatives off-planet as well, and many of them wage a guerrilla war against the Coalition. Others wait in the shadows, gathering resources and waiting for an opportunity to strike. Weaponized starships, bipedal combat frames, rail guns, particle accelerator rifles… These are the deadly tools of the trade employed on all sides. 

Earth-based "terrorism" is a constant cause of panic in coalition media. Yet, murmurs of pro-earth sympathy are growing faster than the coalition can squash them down.

## Shadow Conflict 
Beneath the Coalition’s venear of safety and civilization, a war rages in the shadows. Few know about it, and nobody talks about it. 

This battle, fought between small teams of deniable operatives called Auxiliaries, has been waging in some form or another for decades. Assassination, kidnapping, spying, sabotage, smuggling, theft, arson… the Houses will do anything for a competitive edge. 

But it all remains hidden. Protectorate reports mysteriously disappear. Organized media turns a blind eye. Outspoken “conspiracy theorists” fall strangely silent. The Shadow War rages on, as it always has, unseen by the public at large. 

The Coalition’s seemingly ubiquitous surveillance and security system has holes and exploits, back doors left open by the Houses so that their agents can work behind the scenes. 

Their Auxiliaries, and others of their ilk, have discovered these flaws and exploits. And they make use of them to move contraband, slip through security checkpoints, or accomplish other illicit objectives

## Optimistic Hard Sci-Fi 
Nova Praxis is a sci-fi setting that makes use of a number of miraculous technologies. But just as it is defined by its features, it is also defined by its limits. 
* Psychic abilities are rumored to exist, but have never been reliably demonstrated..yet. 
* Alien life exists on many of the planets humans have colonized, but we have never met another truly intelligent species like ourselves. 
* Force fields can bend light, but not matter. 
* Massive jump drives are the only means of faster than light travel. And the HPA insures a person remains recognizably human… most of the time.
## Nova Praxis and its Themes 
Nova Praxis is a setting about humanity in transition, walking along the razor’s edge. In the wake of unimaginable destruction and loss, mankind has seized the opportunity to start anew. We have the opportunity to become a race of exalted gods, or face extinction kicking and screaming. 

The themes represented in Nova Praxis reflect the dangers of extremist philosophies and behavior as they exist in a post-singularity setting, and the struggle to survive in the chaos between those extremes… 

* Man vs. Machine 
* Tradition vs. Progression 
* Comfortable Mortality vs. Uncertain Eternity 
* Dystopian Liberty vs. Utopian Oppression 
* Capitalism vs. Socialism 
* Apostate vs. Citizen 
* Popular Lies vs. Hidden Truths 

These themes play out against a backdrop of conspiracy, action, and intrigue.
