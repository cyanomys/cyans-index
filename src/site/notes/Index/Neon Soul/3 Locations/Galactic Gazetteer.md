## Mercury

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



Mercury's got some cool spots like solar fields and antimatter hubs. The Coalition had a big showdown with Earth's leftovers at Tellerus Fields. Some think the losers are hiding in the tunnels, but they're chill for now. House Cipriani's the big energy boss, and with all that antimatter moving, pirates are sniffing around. Some reckon it's the old Earth gang causing trouble from the tunnels.
