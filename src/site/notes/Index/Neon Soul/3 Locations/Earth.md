## Geography
### North America 
Formerly vibrant, North America is now a juxtaposition of desertified wastelands and icy tundras. The U.S. faces submerged coastlines, leading to internal migrations. Denver's domed Shelter stands out, offering sanctuary from severe weather. The Midwest's "The Grid" provides refuge zones, with Silicon Enclaves on the West Coast defending against rising seas. The East Coast, transformed by the sea, has morphed into floating city-states, each facing challenges from waterborne diseases. Roving bands of Apostate nomads traverse the wastelands, seeking resources and shelter. Areas near the old Great Lakes are nuclear fallout zones, avoided by most but sought after by certain nomads hunting for forgotten Coalition tech.
### South & Latin America 
The Amazon, reduced to half its original size, is now the vast "Amazon Sea," drastically altering the continent's topography. Coastal cities, like Caracas Port, serve as key external connections. The Andes, a haven amidst this change, hosts suspended cities. Further north, Mexico City, built around a gigantic water reservoir, has evolved into a fortress, and the Caribbean's sunken islands pose challenges for mariners. Areas near ancient Incan territories were devastated by nanite swarms, resulting in lost cities reclaimed by nature, with Apostates rumored to inhabit them.
### Europe 
The expansive Mediterranean has claimed much of southern Europe's land, converting Venice into the "Lost City" and making Rome and Athens significant coastal centers. London has dug deep, resulting in the "Undercroft" Shelter. With lowlands inundated, the Alps offer refuge, with cities like Zurich emerging as central hubs. Nuclear fallout zones, remnants from 21st-century conflicts, scar Eastern Europe. Apostate bands navigate these areas, leveraging the risk for opportunities.
### Russia 
Moscow, fortified against the cold, has evolved to withstand Siberia's approaching chill. Siberia, experiencing a climate shift, has become Russia's nucleus, linked by the vital Trans-Siberian route amidst fallout regions. Apostates traverse Siberia's vastness, often clashing with established communities over resources.
### Asia
Melting Himalayan glaciers have birthed the "Sky Islands" archipelago in Tibet. China's coastlines, especially Shanghai, have transformed into archipelagos. The interior witnesses massive migrations, and Beijing, now subterranean, operates as a grand Shelter network, with the Great Wall remnants indicating radiation-safe zones. India grapples with the Thar Desert's growth, directing migrations eastward. Cities like Kolkata have adapted as floating settlements, and the Himalayas, though less snow-covered, are lush highlands. Nanite swarms ravaged vast stretches of Southeast Asia, rendering them uninhabitable wastelands that are now the territory of hardened Apostate clans.
### Middle East 
Historically rich, the Middle East now contends with freshwater scarcity, converting oil fields to essential water wells. The Petra Pod, a subterranean city network, offers respite from the scorching sun. Jerusalem, despite neutrality, is surrounded by radiation zones, and ancient cities have diminished due to desertification. Nomadic Apostate tribes navigate the dunes, with tales of a prophet-like psychic figure emerging.
### Africa
Africa's landscape is dominated by the expanding Sahara. Coastal urban centers have become major refugee points, with Cape Town's Table Mountain emerging as a sanctuary. The Nile Shelter, juxtaposing old and new, stands along the Nile. The still-verdant Congo Basin, however, faces encroaching desertification. The vast Sahara has become the domain of nomadic Apostate tribes, with legends speaking of oases untouched by the world's decay.
### Oceania 
Australia, with its extinct fauna, sees the outback as a barren land punctuated by sanctuaries. Coastal cities are reinforced against the ocean and sun's harshness, and the "Gray Barrier" Reef stands as a muted testament to past vibrancy. The vast outback is frequented by Apostate caravans, seeking to dig up old Coalition tech amidst the desert heat.
### Antarctica 
Uniquely benefiting from global changes, Antarctica's formerly icy regions are now habitable, harboring secrets from the past and repurposed fallout shelters. Here, isolated Apostate groups have claimed regions, far from the conflicts of the warmer continents.

## Politics
It can pretty much be summarized as: Everything's a city-state now.

1. **North America**: As the U.S. coastlines submerged, federal power diminished. Localized city-states, each governed by its own council or authority, emerged. Denver, with its advanced dome Shelter, became a significant power hub. Some areas, especially those affected by nuclear fallout, have local warlords or chieftains.
2. **Europe**: With the expansion of the Mediterranean, the European Union dissolved, and city-states rose. The Alps became a significant political and trade nexus, and places like Zurich turned into major hubs. Nationalistic movements and coalitions of cities have formed new, smaller political entities.
3. **Asia**:
	- **China**: After the coastal regions transformed into archipelagos, China's centralized power fractured. Beijing remains a stronghold, but regional powers and corporate entities hold significant influence.
	- **India**: Regional governments have gained more power, especially in areas like the Himalayas that are still habitable.
4. **South America**: The transformation of the Amazon basin shifted the power dynamics. Coastal hubs like Caracas Port became influential, and the Andes region saw a coalition of high-altitude city-states form a new political entity.
5. **Africa**: The expansion of deserts decentralized many national governments. Nile Shelter, due to its strategic and habitable position, became a major center of power, with a council governing the vast stretch. 
6. **Middle East**: Freshwater scarcity led to a shift from oil-based power to water-based geopolitics. Some historical cities turned into independent city-states, while others formed alliances for mutual benefit and protection.
7. **Oceania**: Australia's coastal cities fortified themselves and became independent entities. The Sydney Archipelago, for instance, is governed by a maritime council.
8. **Antarctica**: Initially colonized by scientific communities and researchers, it gradually saw migrations due to its habitability. New settlements often have direct democracies, and there's a continuous debate over forming a unified Antarctic government.

Throughout these regions, the rise of Apostate nomads added another layer of complexity. Some areas welcome them for trade and services, while others view them with suspicion. The presence of nuclear fallout zones and the devastation caused by nanite swarms have also led to the rise of militarized zones, quarantine areas, and specialized governance structures to handle these unique threats.

Lastly, corporate influence cannot be underestimated. In many places, mega-corporations fill the void left by traditional governments, offering security and resources in exchange for control.
