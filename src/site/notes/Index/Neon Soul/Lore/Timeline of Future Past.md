# Timeline
+ Nov 2030
+ The Singularity
+ This event was marked by the birth of a truly sentient artificial intelligence capable of reasoning, creativity, and self-motivation. This being was called Mimir.  During its short lifespan, it advanced human technology by nearly a millennia.


+ Feb 2031
+ The Flare, Mimir Killed
+ But three months was not long enough to save earth. Before Mimir was able to present a solution to earth’s climate crises, a massive solar flare devastated the planet. Nearly all satellite communications and all essential functions of technology and modern life were wiped out for months or years. Millions died. With them went Mimir. Though they brought Mimir back as soon as they could, Mimir was never alive like it was before. It was just another super advanced chat bot. It couldn’t save the world. Never again could anyone bring back the spark which made Mimir what it was.


+ 2031-2087
+ Paradigm Shift
+ From the ashes of society, after a literal apocalypse, humanity attempted to rebuild. It took over half a century to build back up to where society previously was, even with Mimir's advancements, so buried in code and obfuscated in petabytes of logs as they were. Finally, decades after Mimir appeared, humanity once again starts advancing technologically such that "dumb" AI becomes more common-place, robots began to replace human workers, corporations establish mining companies on asteroids, and cutting edge 3D printer technology makes manufacturing easier and cheaper than ever before. </br></br>But, current forms of governance were entirely unprepared to deal with the massive paradigm shift this caused. Right as the world started looking up again, these new technologies created instability and plunged many into poverty once again. Worse, the effects of climate change had continued and worsened as humanity had used old sources of energy in the prior century to bootstrap back to a modern world after the Flare.


+ 2091
+ Jump Drive Developed
+ Mimirtech allowed researchers to develop the world's first faster-than-light travel. It only works outside a planet's galaxy well so placement is crucial, but construction begins.


+ 2095-2121
+ Climate Wars
+ The climate wars never really ended on Earth, but we say they ended in 2129. They were a collection of wars here and there, first between China and South Korea, then between India and Pakistan, then Israel and Iran...until eventually the whole world was involved. They were known as the Climate Wars because the heart of all these conflicts was the question: Who has to answer for climate change? Who has to make the hard changes? After over a decade of war, the earth was pockmarked with nuclear fallout zones and rogue nanite swarms. There was a brief climate effect of the small nuclear warheads used (a "nuclear autumn" called The Death) which provided a reprieve from the warming in the worst way imaginable. 


+ 2121
+ The Treaty of Tokyo
+ A cease-fire was signed in Tokyo as birth rates were falling due to the nuclear fallout and nearly every major country was at its breaking point. Mass revolts wracked the world and numerous coups were in progress or had already succeeded across the world -- to little effect. A cohort of "neutral" outside entities -- the CEOs of massive tech corporations, now comparatively trustworthy and peaceful -- had spawned, calling themselves "The Coalition of Peacekeepers," with widespread global support from civillians and populist politicians. </br></br>They promised to create new habitats for humanity on other worlds as a solution to the climate crisis; many of these powers already had outposts or such projects in progress. With the help of citizens all over the world, they convinced the majority of the UN to sign a peace treaty to end the war, with the stipulations that space would belong solely to the Coalition and no other entitiy, and that all of the nation states that used nuclear or nano weapons would come under stewardship of the Coalition until Launch Day.


+ 2122
+ National Identification Centers
+ Under Coalition control, the war had ended, nuclear and nanite cleanup was in full swing, and universal basic income was established. The coalition used military nanite technology to develop "Compilers", which could build things from the ground up using only proteins or molecules. Using these in combination with armies of AI drones and robots, temporary shelters were built in every country: mega-hives where people could shelter from the elements. The world seemed like it would finally turn into the utopia they had hoped for...but people got more than they bargained for. Centers were created to assign every person, regardless of nationality, a Coalition Pre-Identification Number. A new system called the Reputation System was designed, with the plan that over the next 20 years, the contribution of every person and their families would be measured by the (already extensive) coalition surveillance systems. Then, an advanced AI algorithm would determine who had provided the most "value" to humanity -- and who got to go to the off-world habitats first.


+ 2137
+ The Omega Protocols
+ The Coalition and various governments agree to put certain limits on AI, in light of the fact that future Singularity-level AI might have a negative opinion of humanity and pose an existential threat. This was initially an unpopular idea, but was significant boosted when an anti-Coalition group attempted to recreate Memir, and used their near-singularity AI tech to create a supervirus that devastated the Mesh.


+ April 2, 2142
+ Launch Day / The Exodus
+ There were mass riots on launch day, as unsurprisingly, primarily rich elites had made it onto the roster for the first launch. As the space elevator lifted the first rockets out of Earth's gravity well, the world literally burned. The began the 30 years of the Exodus. (Easter egg: April 2, 2142 was an arbitrarily chosen for the launch date due to its significance in a classic work called "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.")


+ 2172
+ The Last Launch
+ The launches continued yearly for 30 years after Launch Day. The civil unrest had unsurprisingly lowered a lot of people's rep, but eventually about 6 million upstanding coalition citizens - 3/4 of Earth's population at the time -- would leave for space. But, the launches slowed, as fewer and fewer of earth's remaining citizens were..."good" citizens. The Coalition announced in 2189 that new year's day of 2220 would be the last Coalition-funded launch. All further launches would need to be funded by the Earthling governments....who had largely become puppet states at this time. The Coalition left, washed their hands of earth, and the remaining earthlings were left to pick up the pieces. 


+ 2172-2190's
+ The Consolidation Wars
+ War immediately broke out on Earth to reseat the traditional foundations of power. (This is the part where I conveniently insert the map from Interface Zero). At the same time, after a decade or so of peace, the ironically named Coalition of Peacekeepers started a decades long cold war that saw the rise, fall, and consolidation of many of the corps that made up the Coalition. The six corps who had control of the largest habs remained, now called "houses", and formed a new government: The Coalition of Free Houses. 


+ 2187
+ Memir Leak
+ During the wars, using modern quantum unecryption technology, more of memir's old code was unlocked on Earth to create better weapons, but in 2187 it was leaked to the galactic public.


+ 2190s-2200s
+ Technological Advancement
+ Combined with the new era of corporate stability and growth under the Coalition, the new pieces of Memir created massive technological advancement: Simulacra, Apotheosis, and Gene Splicing.


+ 2203
+ First Major Earth Terrorism Attack
+ This was the first major attack on a Coalition space station by an earthling terrorist group.


+ 2209
+ Humanity Preservation Act
+ Members of various Purist movements actively fight against the proliferation of augmentation technology. They fear that they will one day be forced to augment themselves to remain competitive or even safe. The Humanity Preservation Act was put into place to limit how far a person can be legally augmented, ensures that minds suffering from extreme Fragmentation are not restored, and bans the practice of leaving more than one copy of a mind active at a time.


+ 2211
+ War with ATLAS Colony
+ The ATLAS Colony, a colony around a nearby star with a large population of apostates, earthlings, and earth-simpathizers, stockpiled weapons during the Consolidation Wars and is now launching attacks on other Coalition Colonies. Isolated incidents have also occured in the Sol system.


+ 2223
+ Present Day.
