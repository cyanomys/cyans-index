Let's say you just woke up from being cryogenically frozen in 2023, and it's 2223. Here's what you'll need to know.
# The State of Things
The Singularity happened. That is to say, a sentient super-intelligent AI woke up, advanced human understanding of science by millenia in just a few months.  But before it could solve world peace or the climate change problem for us, it got taken out by a solar flare, and all the kings horses and all the kings men couldn't put humpty dumpty back together again. And society collapsed for a while. 

So uh, sorry to break this to you, but you shouldn't be too surprised....the earth is fucked. Between The Flare, the climate crisis, nuclear war, and rogue nanite superweapons, the Blue Planet is more of a dusty, greenish-tan these days. About 85% of humans live in space now. More on the space tech later.

Feudal corps-turned-governments, called the Coalition (of ""Free"" ""States""), run a supposedly post-scarcity utopia in space for a majority of us, while earth is a dystopian hellhole for those who got left behind. Earth is run by the skeletons of earth governments holed up in hive cities called Shelters.

# Technology
This is the best part, seeing the look on your face when I tell you what our tech is like these days. Memir really allowed us to rocket past our wildest dreams.
### Compilers
First there's **compilers**. They're a bit like your 3D printers, but way better. The most advanced ones use nanotechnology to assemble elemental atoms into finished goods. Usually only corp manufacturers have those though. Most people have an protein compiler at home (it makes food), and you can usually find a battered molecular compiler at a community center that takes public domain templates. Rich people and tech bros might have nice high-res molecular compilers. Compilers are the main reason we live in a post-scarcity world up here in space. The tech is strictly patented by the Coalition and they don't like sharing it with Earth or Apostates though.....uh, we'll get to that part later.
### Habs & Transport
Most people up here in space live in **habs** (habitats), which are cities and towns built under huge domes, with climate controls inside. **Drones** deliver almost everything you might need to your doorstep. Most people use trains or **hovercraft** with small nuclear reactors to get around on-planet. 

We have **jump-rings** that let you travel between galaxies pretty quickly, but they only work outside a planet's gravity well. Between planets, you'll have to hitch a ride on a **space taxi** or charter a ship of your own -- though it still only takes a few days to get between habs. Goods and raw materials are constantly shipped between asteroids, planets, and even star systems.
### Extranet
Next is the **extranet**, also called the **Mesh**. It's like your old internet, but everywhere, everything, all the time. In Coalition space and even most colonies, there's sensors, mics, cameras, touch panels, RFID chips, you name it -- everywhere, built into everything. Back in the age of unnecessary internet toasters that might sound pretty stupid, but now everyone is plugged in -- sometimes literally, I'll get there in a minute -- so it makes more sense. Now we have internet toasters that will make you toast with a thought! But you have to watch an ad before it'll give you your toast.
### TAPs
So about the plugging in -- there's something called a **Tendril Access Processor (TAP)**, a brain-machine interface that merges nanotechnology, neuromorphic neural networks, and global information processors to create a sensory experience known as Hyper Reality. In **Hyper Reality**, digital objects and information are seamlessly integrated into the user's perception, allowing for interactive and immersive experiences. But, hyper reality can be pretty risky, as hackers exploit this technology to steal identities, trick people, and even hijack people's bodies. 

Most media these days is in VR, or **virtual reality**. It's like hyperreality, except its a complete experience, like you're walking around in an entirely different world, with sensory stimuli and everything. Honestly, FOMO for virtuality is the main reason most people got over their ick about the TAP, and got one.
### Cyber/Bioware
The TAP has opened the door for people to get **Cyberware**. A lost arm might be replaced by a TAP-controlled machine limb capable of interfacing directly with the nervous system. Blindness might be cured by replacing the eye with an optical sensor capable of not only seeing as well as a normal eye, but at much larger distances or even in different spectrums of light. Some people even *elect* to chop off parts of their body and update them with cyberware. 

**Bioware** is an alternative to cyberware that uses flesh instead of metal and is much more subtle, but its a hell of a lot more expensive. The aux naturale look is the most popular right now, owing to that; but some people don't care as much about sticking out as they do about the utility.
### Artificial Intelligence
As you might imagine, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is extremely common. There was the **Singularity**, like I said, who named themself Memir. Thankfully they wanted to *help* humanity, and died before they thought better of it. But regular old AI is still part of almost everything you do on the Extranet these days, and makes possible things you couldn't dream of. 

We've never achieved another super-intelligence after Memir, but pretty recently **"True" AI** re-entered the arena -- with emotions, personalities, internal thoughts, the whole nine yards. But all that is at the cost of the advanced computing power, see. Unfortunately we still haven't figured out how to make true AI much smarter than humans yet, and if the Coalition has anything to say about it, we *wont*. There was some sort of "je ne sais quoi" with Memir -- some say it was a one-in-a-million flipped bit; some say it was god.

True AI usually live on the Extranet or in VR, dwelling in worlds of their own or others' creation, and even doing everything a normal human would do with other humans, playing games, falling in love, you name it. More adventurous true AI might inhabit a ship, a drone, a car, or catch a ride in someone's TAP. Sometimes you can even find a true AI running around in an **android** or even **bioroid** body. Lots of times you don't even know you're talking to one. As you can imagine this is all very controversial.
### Simulacra (SIMs)
We don't just have silicon AI though, we also have **Simulacra**, or Sims. They're whole human beings, vat grown, who pop out all wet and slimy and with a head full of memories of a life they've never lived. Simulacra were developed by a now-extinct corp to be used as soldiers, but after the Consolidation War they were banned by the Coalition. 

There are still a lot around. People don't trust them on account of all their memories being fake. They have to work to earn Coalition citizenship, and they're not particularly welcome on Earth, seeing as they're another mouth to feed that isn't a "real" human. However, I hear they're still making them out on the great frontier. Sometimes a fringe religious sect steals a few antique vats and makes for the stars, then populates a whole colony with sims, ready to answer to their every beck and call.
### Gene Splicing
While we're on the subject of controversies...**genetic engineering** has been around for quite a while now -- like I mentioned above, there's Bioware, plus we can cure most genetic health conditions now if you have the money and rep for it. Few average people up here in space have to live with very serious health conditions like cancer or MS, though there's been a few alien super-viruses that are giving our advanced healthcare tech a run for its money. Elites can eliminate even small medical difficulties or physical flaws from themselves or even their unborn children. 

But in the last couple decades,  and here's the part that makes people mad -- they've developed **gene splicing**. It was first developed to make people better fit for living on exoplanets, but it quickly got out of hand. Should you wish, you can go to a gene doc and splice your DNA with that of an animal to become faster, stronger, or gain heightened senses. The vast majority of people who get spliced look just like the average joe, though many choose to look more animal than human; it’s a fashion statement in the right crowds. But, there's a lot of discrimination against spliced folk, some people calling it unholy, or accusing people of beastiality.
### Apotheosis
Then there's **Apotheosis**, which is like the TAP on steroids. While the TAP lets your brain interface with silicon, Apotheosis makes your brain *run* on silicon. It's a process where you slowly let nanites eat and replace your brain (which, depending on who you ask, may or may not preserve your soul.) Once you're apotheosized -- this is also called having a **Mindset** (the nanite swarm instead of a brain) -- you can be backed up and fully transferred between **bio and cyber sleeves**. Mindsets are pretty recent and they are *really* controversial. Some people say a human with a mindset is no better than a Sim. Others say this is the next evolution of humanity. Who knows?

# The Coalition
I've mentioned the Coalition quite a bit so far but I guess I should give you the high level details.  

It's a lot to explain, so in very simple terms, the "Coalition of Peacekeepers" started as a bunch of tech companies that took control after the major earth Governments nearly blew up the planet. They started the rep system way back on Earth -- before it became like money and voting, it was just reputation -- and used it to measure each person's contribution to humanity. They took mankind to space with them, and left behind the ones who weren't good enough. 

Ironically, once they got to space these corps did a lot of shuffling and "Consolidation", which was a shadowy cold war. Eventually we ended up with the newly renamed "Coalition of Free States" and six major Houses (dynastic megacorps) controlling everything.
### Life in the Coalition
Most folks nowadays, around 80% of them, are part of the Coalition. They pretty much lays claim to all the explored space out there (emphasis on "claims"). So, if you're a registered Coalition citizen, you automatically become a member of a House, which basically wears two hats: your local government and your employer. 

These Houses make sure everyone follows both the Coalition's rules and their own House Laws, which can vary quite a bit depending on the House itself. They've got their own unique ways of doing things; some are all business-like, while others take a more feudal approach. Unlike the old-school nations, these Houses don't care about borders. No matter where you are, you better follow the Coalition and your own House's rules. 

As big corporations, the Houses pretty much run all the businesses within the Coalition. Even though each House has its own specialty markets, regular citizens can set up subsidiary companies to make or offer just about any legal product or service. It's thanks to these subsidiaries that every House ends up with at least a few fingers in all the pies.
### The Houses
#WIP
### Reputation
You're probably wondering how a post-scarcity economy works. Basically it means that we have more than enough of everything to go around. That's not exactly true -- that's where rep rating comes in -- but its certainly a lot more true than when you were kicking around. The resources of space are nearly limitless, if a little boom-and-bust at times. 

Everyone who's a Coalition citizen has something called a Rep Rating, which is like an alternative to money, and voting, and social standing, all rolled into one. Any time you're in the mesh in Coalition space, which is functionally all the time, you're being constantly surveilled. You be a good little citizen, you make everyone happy, your rep gets bumped, you get to have more resources and more of a say in the governing of things, and also more respect. You dabble in some crime, or aren't very likable, or maybe disagree with your corporate overlords -- your rep gets hit, and you get less. You can get rep bumps and hits from individuals too, sorta like likes back in your day. Most people do something called "defaulting", so they don't have to work and get all their needs met as long as they keep their rep rating mediocre and don't stick out.

Everyone who's not a coalition citizen -- if you're in space or were born in space, that's called being an Apostate, because the Houses don't like non-Coalition citizens, but if you're from Earth that's called being an Earthling -- they use cryptocurrencies of varying legalities. The most popular one is called Bits. Bits are super illegal in Coalition space but also real common if you know the right people.

Regardless, rep rating isn't exactly...non-scarce. It's artificially scarce. When times are tough -- or when the Coalition needs to crack down and get more control -- rep bumps aren't worth quite as much, or might be a little harder to earn. Weird how that happens. And somehow the Houses still always have something to be fighting about behind closed doors (doing their bidding is a good way to increase your rep rating, too.) But, in reality, up here in space most people are fed, sheltered, have access to the extranet, and don't need to worry all that much about survival. It may not be a glamorous existence but its a living. Folks find other stuff to do with their time, if they have the rep for it. You're allowed to start subsidiary corps of the Houses you're in, so some people do that. Or they just rot in VR, most of the time, to be honest.
# Earth
Unless you're on earth, though, like I said. On Earth they don't have enough of anything. On earth everybody slaves for barely enough to eat, a barely potable water ration, and a bed in an apartment packed six to a room. They have the remains of old Earth governments, but they're more like overrun hospitals triaging their dying Shelters. Most of the stuff on earth is made by old-fashioned earth corps, but they trade for raw materials and sometimes finished goods with the coalition too, in exchange for running the Coalition's worst prisons.

Well, and then there's the few people who don't live in the shelters. They're called Nomads. Lots of em are Apostates and escaped criminals -- they dare the weather and radiation and nanites and god-knows-what-else for the hopefully sweet taste of freedom. I mean, it better be sweet. I wouldn't do it.

Why doesn't the god-like Coalition fix Earth? The Coalition doesn't want to invest in Earth for a couple reasons. Firstly, lots of Earthlings don't want to live under the Coalition's surveillance state, and the remaining governments aren't too keen to give up power again either. Secondly, uh, I kinda glossed over this part earlier but....the Coalition sort of left behind the earthlings they deemed "inferior" when they went to space anyway. They don't think earth is good stock for Coalition citizens anymore. It's pretty nasty and the people up here in space just pretend that isn't why but that's the truth.

We have a bit of a problem these days with what the coalition calls "earth terrorism".  Earth wants its share of the galaxy pie. Earth says we were all promised the stars but they were unfairly left behind, and that they should have their own governing power, too. Earth terrorism is getting disturbingly common. Some people call it revolution, some people call it reclamation, some just call it good old fashioned war...but according to the Coalition, it's terrorism. And to be fair, earth terrorists have done some unmentionably awful and disgusting things. Fortunately or unfortunately, the Coalition roundly wins most of the time. 

Things might be changing soon though. There's a big colony called ATLAS around a nearby binary star system that's got a lot of former earthings and earth sympathizers in it, and recently they've launched some attacks on other Coalition colonies. They've already taken one and some fear they're gonna come for Sol next.

# Space
Explaining all of space is a pretty tall order. There is a *lot* of space. I'm pretty sure I couldn't even point to Cygnus Alpha on a map. So here's a brochure I picked up on my way in and I'll give you a little context. \[Read: Feel free to skim. Information boxes optional.]

![Nova Praxis Map.png](/img/user/Attachments/Nova%20Praxis%20Map.png)
## Sol
### Mercury 
Mercury's got some cool spots like solar fields and antimatter hubs. The Coalition had a big showdown with Earth's leftovers at Tellerus Fields. Some think the losers are hiding in the tunnels, but they're chill for now. House Cipriani's the big energy boss, and with all that antimatter moving, pirates are sniffing around. Some reckon it's the old Earth gang causing trouble from the tunnels.

> [!INFO] Mercury
>**Gravity**: .37G 
**Day Length**: 58.65 Earth Days 
**Population**: 52k 
**Key Locations**:
> - **Specular Spread**: Solar panel facilities (House Cipriani)
> - **Base 10**: Antimatter production (House Cipriani)
> - **Tellerus Fields**: Major battle site between Earth remnants and the Coalition
> - **Mercurial Gateway**: One of two Sol system jump rings
> - **Mercurian Tunnels**: Connects habitats and facilities
> - **Balor**: Surface habitat and vacation spot

### Venus
Venus, a volcanic world with a toxic atmosphere, isn't a Coalition favorite but suits apostates seeking freedom. Gondolin's population struggles with space, and while they have a compiler, its existence is hush-hush to avoid Coalition attention. The Maiden, besides research, is a hub for clandestine activities.

> [!INFO] Venus
> **Gravity**: .91G 
> **Day Length**: 243 Earth Days 
> **Population**: 438k (413k in Gondolin, 25k on The Maiden) 
> 
> **Key Locations**:
> - **Gondolin**: A hidden apostate city, the largest in the solar system, built by non-replicating Vulcan swarms. Overpopulated, with one-child laws. Led by SIM mayor Camber Roche, advocating for more SIM conversions. Mostly former Americans, Italians, Greeks, and Africans. Relies on black market trading and has a secret, functional compiler.
> - **The Maiden**: An orbiting research station studying Venus and hosting experiments. Houses a weapons lab of House Dalianis and serves as a meeting point for covert deals with Gondolin.

### Luna
Luna, humanity's first extraterrestrial touchpoint, now boasts several major cities and numerous stations. While cities like Serro represent scientific advancement and luxury, Asola reflects the struggles of the working class. Rho, the entertainment hub, hides a darker side of illegal activities and insurgent groups. Odysseus Station, a research beacon, recently faced a mysterious explosion, fueling speculations of espionage. Luna was the site of the first earthling terrorist attack.

> [!info] Luna 
> **Gravity**: .16G 
> **Day Length**: 27.3 Earth Days 
> **Population**: 8.5 mil 
> 
> **Key Locations**:

> - **Asola**: Second largest, known for manufacturing and House Tsarya's facilities. Home to many apostates, with a challenging path to House membership.
> - **Rho**: Entertainment capital, backed by Houses Cipriani and Silva. A mix of luxury and underground dealings, also a base for the Talons of Freedom.
> - **Odysseus Station**: House Dalianis' space station for jump drive research. Recently faced an explosion, rumored to be a sabotage.

### Mars
Since our first steps on Mars in 2034, the planet has seen a mix of achievements and challenges. From the impressive Olympus to the gritty streets of New Turin, Mars is certainly a showcase of the breadth of human experience. With the recent purist terror incident in Voltair, it's sparked a whole debate about ethics and identity in this new era.

> [!info] Mars
> 
> **Gravity**: .38G
> **Day Length**: 1.03 Earth Days
> **Population**: 21.2 mil
> 
> **Key Locations**:
> - **Olympus**: Mars' pride, built on Olympus Mons. Known for its stunning architecture and as the Coalition's headquarters. Linked to Helios by a beanstalk.
> - **New Turin**: Born from mining, it's now under "House Turin's" shadow. A place where lawlessness meets legacy.
> - **Remus**: Mars' water hub. Regularly hit by ice asteroids to supply water to other cities.
> - **Helios**: Floating above Olympus, it's a mix of education and opulence, housing the Coalition's top brass.
> - **Charon**: Nestled in Valles Marineris, it's a beacon for terraforming research.
> - **Minos**: A former mining town, now a budding apostate enclave with ties to House Turin.
> - **Phobos**: Mars' moon and House Dalianis' domain. A blend of industry and luxury, it's also home to the famed Thetis Revival Labs.
> - **Deimos**: Mars' other moon. Kratos trains the military, while Voltair, with its strong Catholic presence, recently faced a terror attack.

### Asteroid Belt
The Asteroid Belt has long been a hub for mining, with Houses Silva and Dalianis leading the charge. Even with mining slowing down, many asteroids, with their vast tunnels, have become bases for pirates and other rogue groups. One such group, the Children of Adam, has been particularly troublesome. Then there's Tartarus, the galaxy's top-tier prison, and Ceres, which is essential for supplying water to Mars. Quite the mix of places and activities.

> [!INFO]  Asteroid Belt
> 
> - **Gravity**: 0G
> - **Day Length**: Varies
> - **Population**: Roughly 60k–80k
> 
> **Key Locations**:

> - **Tartarus**: A max-security prison by House Dalianis, floating between Mars and the belt.
> - **Ceres**: Mars' main water source. Features Trident, an ice harvesting town, and Anapos Station, an orbital shipping hub.
### Jupiter
While Jupiter itself isn't a hotspot, its moon Europa is buzzing with intrigue. The oceans beneath Europa's icy crust are home to unique extraterrestrial life. The rapid evolution of these creatures has scientists at IT Alpha scratching their heads. And with recent station anomalies, there's more to unravel than ever before.

> [!INFO] Jupiter 
>**Gravity:** 2.36G
>**Length of Day:** 9.8 hr
>**Population:** 2.8 million (including its moons)
>
> **Key Locations:**
> 
> - **Europa's IT Alpha:** An underwater research hub run by Houses Cipriani and Silva, focused on studying Europa's mysterious aquatic life. Lately, the station's been facing power outages, mold issues, and a spike in cancer cases among its crew. The cause? Still a mystery.
### Saturn
Saturn might seem uninteresting, but its rings and Titan moon are bustling with activity. Titan City, larger than Mercury, is a melting pot of House members and serves as a pivotal resource hub. However, beneath its industrious facade, the city grapples with stark divides and a heavy-handed security force, Lighthouse, ensuring order.

> [!INFO] Saturn
>**Gravity:** 1.06G
>**Length of Day:** 10.2 hr
>**Population:** 12.5 million
> 
> **Key Locations:**
> - **Titan City:** Saturn's major hub on its largest moon, Titan. A bustling center for mining operations from Saturn's rings. The city's structure consists of concentric rings, with towering centers operated by different Houses. While the upper echelons manage resources, the lower levels are shadowed realms of labor and desperation.
> - **The Rings:** A massive mining site for dust and water ice, operated by multiple Houses.
### Uranus
Uranus, a distant gas giant, isn't a Coalition hotspot, making it perfect for The Colony's discreet existence. This patchwork community, blending old ships and makeshift structures, has a strong sense of unity. However, the looming shadow of the Children of Dionysus and the mysterious disappearance of the Red Herron ship have stirred unease among the Colonists. The future seems uncertain: will their next battle be with pirates or the Coalition?

> [!INFO] Uranus
> 
>**Gravity:** 0.89G
>**Length of Day:** 17.9 hr
>**Population:** 84k
> 
> **Key Locations:**
> 
> - **The Colony:** A vast floating apostate enclave deep within Uranus' atmosphere, made up of interconnected ships and structures. The largest ship, The Kraken, stands out. The community thrives on unity and resourcefulness, but recent tensions with the Children of Dionysus, a pirate group, threaten their peace.

### Neptune
Neptune, a chilly ice giant, isn't much of a hotspot itself. However, its arcs are mineral goldmines. The Naesock Hub, initially bustling with activity, has seen a shift. While its official operations have dwindled, the hub's lower levels have become a hive of covert activities, all under the watchful eye of House Silva.

> [!INFO] Neptune
> 
>**Gravity:** 1.12G
>**Length of Day:** 19.1 hr
>**Population:** 43k
> 
> **Key Locations:**
> 
> - **Naesock Processing Hub:** Orbiting Triton, this hub once processed materials from Neptune's arcs. Now, while its upper levels remain official, the lower decks have become a bustling apostate enclave and black market hotspot, subtly overseen by House Silva.
> - **The Arcs:** Bands of valuable minerals orbiting Neptune, richer in rare elements than similar structures elsewhere.
