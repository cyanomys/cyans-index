### Themes I want to explore
(For my own sake)
- Class conflict
- Empowering marginalized people 
- Survival and connection in the face of apocalypse and/or dystopia
- AI — no idea really how tho 

And I’m always down for:
- Aliens and conspiracy theorists 
- Unfathomable ancient entities
- Folklore and old magic
